# Hunt the Wumpus

I thought that hunt the wumpus might make for an interesting
TDD exercise, because much of the state of the system is
actually concealed from the human operator.

One way of expressing that is that the game state is
a collaboration between the human player and a random
number generator.

Of course, in a deterministic test, the roles of the
human operator and the random number generator will
need to be played by the test itself.

Can we treat this problem like a [protocol library][1]?
We might consider the game to be a scene, with all of the
current state, and the player and RNG as a pair of
message sources, and a bit of glue code to hold
everything together.
