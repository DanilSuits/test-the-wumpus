# Make the change easy

One useful heuristic in refactoring code is to be thinking
about what test we are going to introduce next, and to
prepare the test subject so that it will be easy to
introduce the new variation in behavior.

So we start surfacing elements pre-demand; rather than
introducing new tests and then taking a long walk
along the RED bar typing the code to pass.

The trick is to not get to far ahead of ourselves.

In the coming case, the big difference is that there
is going to be some input instead of no input, and
therefore more messages will print later.

So I'm going to start thinking about how that is going
to work now, so that I don't need it under the red bar.

In the first pass, I'll just write out comments, as a
way of helping me to see my logic without over committing
to it.  This also gives me a way to track the thoughts
without violating YAGNI quite so aggressively as I
might otherwise.
