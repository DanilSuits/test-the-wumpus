# Game State

One last idea I can see to introduce that will make
life easier at the _next_ step is an approximation
of game state.

That gives me hook on which I can build a branch.

The branch is in illusion in this case; we always
take the branch on the first pass; we never reach
the predicate on the second because the interactive
loop exits before then.
