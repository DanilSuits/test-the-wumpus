# Interactive Loop

In an earlier iteration, I tried `GameLoop` as my spelling,
then did some research.

One of the concerns that regularly shows up in game-loops
is the concept of time -- how long were we idle waiting
for signal for the player, how much time distortion do
we need to catch up?  And none of that vocabulary really
matters for wumpus, where the tokens only move in response
to a player's interaction with the game.

I rejected the `EventLoop` spelling, because I don't want
to confuse it with lower level mechanics like typing
and mouse clicking.

`Interactive-Loop` it is.  Until I find a better name.

What I realized on this pass is that I haven't previously
understood the distinct responsibilities of the interactive
loop.

I had originally spiked a `Quit` action for the game; and
in some games that would make sense.  But Wumpus just waits,
waits, waits in the depths....  Expecting the game logic
to understand input exhaustion; that's under motivated.
