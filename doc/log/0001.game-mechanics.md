# Implementation notes

[Original source code][1]

The original version of the game uses a fixed arrangement
of the 20 rooms.

The rooms have three passages each.  We can imagine the top
half of the maze as a graph - the root links to three nodes
those three nodes each link to two new nodes underneath.  The
bottom of the graph is a reflection of this.

In the original maze:
```json
{
  "1" : {
    "2" : [ 3, 10 ],
    "5" : [ 4, 6 ],
    "8" : [ 7, 9 ]
  },
  "20" : {
    "19" : [ 18, 11 ],
    "16" : [ 17, 15 ],
    "13" : [ 14, 12 ]
  }
}
```

There's a weird structure as the two half mazes join
- each node in the outer ring has an edge to another 
node in the outer ring, and a node in the outer ring 
on the opposite side.


The initial squares of the maze occupants are calculated
randomly, but positions where two occupants start in the
same square are automatically discarded.

Once the game begins, only the wumpus and the player move.

The only other change of state is the arrow count - running
out of arrows before slaying the wumpus is a loss.

RNG elements include the assignment of initial positions,
the bats, the movement of the wumpus when it wakes, and
the flight of the arrow if you don't steer it correctly.
