# Prompts

I'm immediately pulling the String into its own class,
because very little of the logic actually cares what
the message is; it's just a opaque token that gets
passed around.

[Parnas][1] teaches us that decisions define module boundaries,
and that includes decisions about spelling.

I'm using the spelling `prompt`, but what I really mean
is any block of prose intended to be displayed to the human
player.  I suspect that the general form of a prompt
will be a list or array, rather than a single line, but
I'm not sure where that distinction belongs.

Clearly some display blocks will require parameters, so
that will need to be worked out at some point.

It's easy to image using some sort of String template
tool to manage the text representations.
