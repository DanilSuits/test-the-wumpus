# Interactive Shell

The initial constraint that I'm going to work
with is the assumption that the game can be run
as an interactive shell application.

So the interface between the human player and
the machine will be standard input and standard
output.

## Configuration

We already know of at least two distinct environments
in which the game may be run; in "production" with
a human player, and in "test" played by the testing
framework.

[12 Factor] teaches us that variation between _deploys_
should be controlled via the environment, so we will
follow that guideline.  The [Doctrine of Useful Objects] 
teaches us that we will want to have inert and active
variants of many capabilities; the choices we make will
vary from deploy to deploy, so they should be controlled
by the environment.

Therefore, we should expect to be able to configure the
composition of the game by passing an environment description.

I find that there is a bit of tension between choosing
inert defaults, and choosing defaults that make things
easy for the customer.  So I'm not yet sure how that
is going to play out.  It may be that on the first pass,
each of the choices will be explicit, and defaults will
be determined later.

Composition variation from one _instance_ to another would
normally be communicated via the command line, I feel.
There isn't any of that in the original implementation of
Wumpus, but it is easy to imagine that a game might start
from a specified seed.  That might come in really handy
when we want to start generating games from specific
interesting positions.

## Java Runtime

Running as an interactive shell, I expect most invocations
to come via `main(String[] args)`.  I want to be executing
as much "real" code as possible, without needing to be
coupled tightly to `java.lang.System`.  So the responsibility
of `main` will be that interface with the system, and
forwarding those collaborators to methods that do the real
work.

I don't feel any longing to test the `main` method itself.
It's so simple that it obviously has no deficiencies.
