From the point of view of the human player, there
are really only four interesting commands during
the game play:

* Move the hunter
* Shoot an arrow
* Reset to last checkpoint
* Move to a new maze.

Reset to last checkpoint is the only one of these
that doesn't potentially include non-deterministic
behaviors.
