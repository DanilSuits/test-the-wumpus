# JUnit Calibration

A problem that I am constantly running into is struggling to
get my unit tests running.

So for this exercise, I've introduced a calibration test; it
has nothing to do with this specific solution.

The test serves a couple of purposes:

* It establishes that my environment can actually discover 
the test packages.
* It ensures that my environment can detect the test definitions
within those packages - that I have the test environment
properly configured to recognize the test annotations
* It provides a trivial way to introduce a failure, so that
I can review how test failures are reported in the environment.

## TODO

A better approach would be to use an environment variable to
determine the pass/fail behavior of the check.  In that way
the observed behavior could be varied without needing to
disturb the deployment package.
