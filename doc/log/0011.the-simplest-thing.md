# The Simplest Thing

The simplest thing that could possibly work
is often a hack.  I consider being able to copy/paste
from the test to the subject a very good sign -- its
a tautological pass, but it shows that the pre-factoring
left us ready to make the change that we need.

I think it's useful to keep in mind that Simplest Thing
is primarily a writers block technique.  Once you've
got a solution that you hate, you can begin to carve it
up to create something better.

_It won't always work_; nobody promises that you won't
get caught in a local minimum when you start trying to
clean things up.  But it gives you a way to make progress.

When there doesn't seem to be a simple thing, that suggests
that perhaps we've grabbed the wrong next test.
