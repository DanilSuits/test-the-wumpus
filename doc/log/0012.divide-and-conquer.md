# Divide and Conquer

A way of keeping this problem manageable is
to introduce some simpler games to play.

In that approach, we can concentrate on
the management of the _session_ state machine,
without getting lost in the details of the
wumpus game rules.

Two variations we might introduce:

* One in which the player gets to choose whether
to win or lose.

* One in which a die roll determines whether
the player wins or loses.

What that gets use is the protocol around the
interactive session itself -- showing instructions,
reporting whether the game was a win or a loss,
asking the player if they want to repeat the
same position, what happens when the input is
exhausted.
