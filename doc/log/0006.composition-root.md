# Composition Root

Mark Seemann has persuaded me that I want to have a clear
separation between the composition root and the rest of my
code.

So I expect to ultimately end up with a structure that looks
something like

 * An instance of a stateless module
 * A method within that module, that takes a description
 of the environment and returns a factory
 * The factory will have a method that accepts an input
 and output stream, and returns a runnable
 * And then the main thread will be yielded to the runnable
 for the duration.
 
In the short term, I expect to do as much as I possibly can
within a single method.  Java allows the creation of internal
classes, so I can experiment with scoping different arrangements
of responsibilities without having to leave the compilation unit.

The point to this it will be easier to see the dependencies, and
to observe when two different parts of the code are changing
_together_.  My hope is that by making clusters of code that
changes together, additional structure will appear.

I think that pattern should hold right up to the point where
I have a clear boundary between the orchestration
(and its dependencies) and the state machine (and _its_
dependencies).
